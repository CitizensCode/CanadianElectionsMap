Canadian Elections Map of Historical Vote Leanings
====================

Data analysis for a polling-district-by-polling-district visualization of historical election data.

Cedric Sam did some great work a few years ago taking poll-by-poll federal election data and visualizing it, allowing people to quickly view margins of victory, voter turnout and party-by-party votes: http://earth.smurfmatic.net/canada2011/polls/#130031

The poll data originally came from here:
http://elections.ca/scripts/resval/ovr_41ge.asp?prov=&lang=e1

And the geo data came from here: http://geogratis.gc.ca/api/en/nrcan-rncan/ess-sst/c0fdfa13-8851-5ade-abaf-09445d390d31.html

This builds upon his work and make it possible to look at historical vote leanings in a single view.
